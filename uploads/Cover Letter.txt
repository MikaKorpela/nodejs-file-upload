I've been working in telecommunications domain for a long time, and interest has grown to see the IT industry also from other perspectives.

Even though I'm working for system architecture, I've participated also to prototyping and coding work, and kept myself up-to-date with latest implementation technologies with self-studies and hobby projects.

I'm interested in backend development, data processing and data analyze with different implementation technologies; like Java and Go.

I consider myself as a good problem analyzer and problem solver, and I'm interested to consider different approaches and implementation alternatives.

Outside of working hours my hobbies are music, and lately 3D-design and 3D-printing. I have also a growing interest to IoT and robotics, which goes nicely together with 3D-printing and programming with micro controllers.
